# C-projects
A collection of my mini tic tac toe for the midterm project of Computer Programming II. 

This collection of files helps a user run a tie tac toe interface where two players can play against each other. It determines whether there is a winner or an overall draw. It also includes a test suite to ensure that the game is debugged and works properly. 

Including test suites is often a good idea when creating programming projects in any language because it allows you to test the rigidity of individual functions and components.

The game can be run by pressing 'Play' in any C/C++ compiler. It can also be run from the terminal.
